FoodApp is developed to use and learn modern android development technologies and techniques. 

The libraries used during development of FoodApp are listed in below:

1- Navigation Component (to navigate between fragments)
2- Intuit ssp/sdp       (to have flexibility for different screen sizes)
3- Retrofit2            (to make http requests)
4- Glide                (to load images from internet)
5- ViewModel lifecycle    
6- Hilt                 (for dependency injection)
7- Room                 (to store data locally with SQLite database)


This project has been developed with MVVM architecture while having only single activity as navigation host with many fragments.
