FoodApp is developed to use and learn modern android development technologies and techniques. <br />
<br />
The libraries used during development of FoodApp are listed in below:<br />
<br />
1- Navigation Component (to navigate between fragments)<br />
2- Intuit ssp/sdp       (to have flexibility for different screen sizes)<br />
3- Retrofit2            (to make http requests)<br />
4- Glide                (to load images from internet)<br />
5- ViewModel lifecycle    <br />
6- Hilt                 (for dependency injection)<br />
7- Room                 (to store data locally with SQLite database)<br />
<br />
<br />
This project has been developed with MVVM architecture while having only single activity as navigation host with many fragments.<br />
